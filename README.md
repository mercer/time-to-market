other reasons companies care about improving ttm:
---------------------------------------------------
Here are some additional reasons companies care about improving their time to market:

Efficient resource management — Having a reliable timeline will allow you to prepare in advance for transportation times and costs, build schedules based on part lead times and headcount planning to satisfy the needs in various project phases.

Predictable schedules and launch dates — The product development process is long and complicated. If you can accurately predict when your product will ship, you can take advantage of tradeshows, holiday buying seasons and other marketing opportunities.

Increased total revenue — The earlier you get your product to market (without cutting corners or compromising quality) the greater the revenue you can generate because your product faces less competition. In addition, you earn revenue for more of the product lifecycle.

Organizations pursue TTM improvement for a variety of reasons. Some variations of TTM are
--------------------------------------------------------------
Pure speed, that is, bring the product to market as quickly as possible. This is valuable in fast-moving industries, but it is not always the best objective.

More predictable schedules. Rather than reaching the market as soon as possible, delivering on schedule, for example to have the new product available for a trade show, can be more valuable. In addition to processes such as Stage-Gate or Six Sigma, project risk management (see References below) is an effective tool here.

Minimizing resources, especially labor. Many managers figure that the shorter the project the less it will cost, so they attempt to use TTM as a means of cutting expenses. Ironically, a primary means of reducing TTM is to staff the project more heavily,[citation needed] so a faster project may actually be more expensive.

Flexibility to make changes. Product innovation is intimately tied to change, and often the need for change appears midstream in a project. Consequently, the ability to make changes during development without being too disruptive can be valuable. For example, one’s goal could be to satisfy customers, which could be achieved by adjusting product requirements during development in response to customer feedback. Then TTM could be measured from the last change in requirements until the product is delivered.
